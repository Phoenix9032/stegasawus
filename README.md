# Stegasawus
Detecting whether steganography is present in an image using machine learning.
- Generates dataset for training.
- Creates feature vectors from statistical moments of autocorrelation and discrete wavelet decomposition measures.
- Exploratory plots of dataset.
- Preliminary model comparisons.

### Future Work
- Run model benchmarks for specific message sizes and embedding generator types.
- Look at model performance for different image types (only cats and dogs at the moment).
